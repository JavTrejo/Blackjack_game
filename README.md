- The player and the dealer are dealt two cards. The dealer's second card is "face down", so you can only see the first card.
- If the player chooses to double down their bet is doubled, and they get an extra card.
- If the player chooses to hit, they get an additional card until they are satisfied with their hand or they go over twenty-one.
- If the player's hand total is higher than the dealer's, the player wins and receives a payout equal to their bet.
- If the player's hand exceeds twenty-one, they automatically lose regardless of the dealer's hand.
- The player starts with a bankroll of one-hundred, and the game ends when the player's bankroll reaches zero or when they decided to quit the game.
